# ![3mf logo](images/3mf_logo_50px.png) 3D Manufacturing Format

This repository contains the full specification for the 3MF 3D Manufacturing Format core specification.

The 3D Manufacturing Format, or 3MF, describes the set of conventions for the use of XML and other widely available technologies to describe the content and appearance of one or more 3D models. It is written for developers who are building systems to process 3MF content.

A primary goal of this specification is to ensure the interoperability of independently created software and hardware systems that produce or consume 3MF content. This specification defines the formal requirements that producers and consumers must satisfy in order to achieve interoperability.

See the [3MF core examples repository](https://github.com/3MFConsortium/3mf-samples/tree/master/examples/core) for 3MF sample files.
